# LOC Measurement Specification

Defines the method for measuring repository size and determining dynamic character limits for AGENTS.md.

## Measurement Command

```bash
tokei -e "*.json" -e "*.yaml" -e "*.yml" -e "*.md" -e "*.sh" -e "*.lock" -e "*.map" -e "*.svg" .
```

**Priority**: This is the **first step** before generating AGENTS.md.

## Tool Installation

If `tokei` is not installed:

```
tokei is not installed.
https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei Please install it from here and try again.
```

## Character Limit by Repository Scale

```yaml
- scale: Small
  loc_range: "≤ 10,000"
  character_limit: 10,000
- scale: Small-Medium
  loc_range: "10,001 ~ 50,000"
  character_limit: 12,000
- scale: Medium
  loc_range: "50,001 ~ 100,000"
  character_limit: 15,000
- scale: Medium-Large
  loc_range: "100,001 ~ 500,000"
  character_limit: 20,000
- scale: Large
  loc_range: "500,001 ~ 1,000,000"
  character_limit: 30,000
- scale: Extra-Large
  loc_range: "> 1,000,000"
  character_limit: 50,000
```

## Workflow

1. Run `tokei` command to get total LOC
2. If tokei not installed → display installation guide and stop
3. Determine repository scale from LOC value
4. Apply corresponding character limit to AGENTS.md generation

## Section Budget Allocation

Distribute the total character limit across sections to prevent front-loading. These are recommended proportions — adjust slightly based on project characteristics.

### Single Repo / Package Document (5 Sections)

```yaml
- section: "1. Overview"
  budget: "5%"
  note: "Keep brief; 1-2 sentences"
- section: "2. Folder Structure"
  budget: "35%"
  note: "Proportional to directory depth and complexity"
- section: "3. Core Behaviors & Patterns"
  budget: "25%"
  note: "Largest section; cross-cutting patterns need detail to be actionable"
- section: "4. Conventions"
  budget: "25%"
  note: "Each convention should include rule + example"
- section: "5. Working Agreements"
  budget: "10%"
  note: "Fixed rules; relatively stable across projects"
```

### Monorepo Root Document (3 Sections)

```yaml
- section: "1. Overview"
  budget: "10%"
- section: "2. Folder Structure"
  budget: "50%"
  note: "Main value of root doc is the structural map"
- section: "3. Working Agreements"
  budget: "40%"
```

## tokei Output Interpretation

Use the **Total** lines value from tokei output:

```
===============================================================================
 Language            Files        Lines         Code     Comments       Blanks
===============================================================================
 TypeScript            150        45000        38000         3000         4000
 JavaScript             30         5000         4200          400          400
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total                 180        50000        42200         3400         4400
===============================================================================
```

In this example: Total Lines = 50,000 → Small-Medium → 12,000 chars limit
